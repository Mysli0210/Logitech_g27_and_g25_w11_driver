# Logitech_g27_and_g25_w11_driver
Extracted 2022.3.0.2 logi_joy_hid driver to make G25 and G27 steering wheels work on W11. 
FFB has been tested in Dirt Rally 2, though there is no profiler application for tuning/calibrating. 
Calibration can be done with other available tools however.

to install the driver: 
- clone/download this repo
- extract it somewhere to your liking, such as the desktop
- open the device manager and find both "HID-compliant gamecontroller"/G25 or G27 USB hid device And the corresponding "USB Input Device"/ G25 or G27 USB device (not hid)
- follow images step 1 through 8 for hid (See images)
- steps 9 - 10 for usb (basically repeating steps 1 through 8)


A more thorough guide might be provided in the future, for now reference this reddit post, but skip getting the drivers and software elsewhere.
